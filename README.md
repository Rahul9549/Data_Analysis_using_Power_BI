#### 1. Data Visualization of Bird Strikes between 2000 â€“ 2011
Transport and communication is one of the crucial domain in field of analytics. Environmental impacts and safety are, nowadays, two major concerns of the scientific community with respect to transport scenarios and to the ever-growing urban areas. A bird strike is strictly defined as a collision between a bird and an aircraft which is in  flight or on a take-off or landing roll. The term is often expanded to cover other wildlife strikes - with bats or ground animals. Bird Strike is common and can be a significant threat to aircraft safety. For smaller aircraft, significant damage may be caused to the aircraft structure and all aircraft, especially jet-engine ones, are vulnerable to the loss of 
thrust which can follow the ingestion of birds into engine air intakes. This has resulted in several fatal accidents. Bird strikes may occur during any phase of flight, but are most likely during the take-off, initial climb, approach and landing phases due to the greater 
numbers of birds in flight at lower levels. To have a closer look the Bird Strike.csv document which depicts the data collected on Bird Strikes by FAA between 2000-2011 . 

#### 2. Analyze Google App Store Data
The Google Play Store, being one of the largest digital distribution service platforms, hosts millions of apps spanning various categories and genres. Understanding the patterns and trends in this dataset can provide valuable insights to developers, investors, and marketers. The goal of this study is to analyze the Google Play Store dataset, focusing on the following objectives:

1 . Identify the distribution of paid and free apps.
2 . Determine the most popular categories of apps.
3 . Analyze the most popular apps in the most popular category.
4 . Assess the number of installations per category.
5 . Explore the Distribution of app ratings.
6 . Explore the relationship between two continuous variables in the dataset.

#### 3. Credit Card Financial Analysis
