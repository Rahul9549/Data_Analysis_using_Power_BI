#### 1. Data Visualization of Bird Strikes between 2000 â€“ 2011
Transport and communication is one of the crucial domain in field of analytics. Environmental impacts and safety are, nowadays, two major concerns of the scientific community with respect to transport scenarios and to the ever-growing urban areas. A bird strike is strictly defined as a collision between a bird and an aircraft which is in  flight or on a take-off or landing roll. The term is often expanded to cover other wildlife strikes - with bats or ground animals. Bird Strike is common and can be a significant threat to aircraft safety. For smaller aircraft, significant damage may be caused to the aircraft structure and all aircraft, especially jet-engine ones, are vulnerable to the loss of 
thrust which can follow the ingestion of birds into engine air intakes. This has resulted in several fatal accidents. Bird strikes may occur during any phase of flight, but are most likely during the take-off, initial climb, approach and landing phases due to the greater 
numbers of birds in flight at lower levels. To have a closer look the Bird Strike.csv document which depicts the data collected on Bird Strikes by FAA between 2000-2011
